function#1 (The General Manager): get_next_line

This is the boss. He doesn't do the hard labor himself; he organizes the workflow and calls the other workers in the correct order.

    static char *leftovers;: This is the most important thing in the entire factory. It's the manager's "magic notepad." This notepad is never thrown away between work shifts (function calls). It stays and remembers what was left over from the last job.

    leftovers = readappend(fd, leftovers);: The manager's first command: "Hey, Assembly function(readappend), take this notepad, go to the warehouse (fd), and keep reading and adding to the notepad until we have enough material to make at least one full line. Then, bring me back the updated notepad."

    if (!leftovers || !*leftovers): After the assembly functionreturns, the manager does a quick check: "Is this notepad completely empty? If so, the factory has finished all its work. Shut everything down and return NULL."

    line = extract_line(leftovers);: The second command: "Hey, Cutting function(extract_line), take this notepad full of material, cut out the final 'product' (the complete first line), and give it to me."

    leftovers = prepare_next_leftovers(leftovers);: The third and final command: "Hey, Cleanup function(prepare_next_leftovers), take the old, messy notepad, get rid of the part we just cut, and prepare a new, clean notepad that contains only the scraps so we're ready for the next shift (the next function call)."

    return (line);: The manager delivers the final "product" that he received from the Cutting worker.

function#2 (The Assembly Worker): readappend

His job is simple but crucial: assemble until complete.

    while (!ft_strchr(leftovers, '\n')): This is his only rule for working. "As long as the manager's notepad does not contain a newline marker (\n), I will keep working."

    bytes = read(fd, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);: "I will read a small piece of raw material (from the file) and put it in my temporary transport cart (buffer)."

    if (bytes <= 0) break;: "If the warehouse (fd) tells me there's no more raw material, I stop working immediately."

    temp_ptr = leftovers;: "I will remember the location of the old notepad before I change it." (This is the most important step for memory management).

    leftovers = ft_strjoin(temp_ptr, buffer);: "I will call the Glue function(ft_strjoin) to stick the contents of my cart (buffer) onto the end of the old notepad (temp_ptr), creating a new, updated notepad."

    free(temp_ptr);: "Now that I have a new, improved notepad, I no longer need the old one. I will throw it in the trash (free) to prevent clutter in the factory (memory leaks)."

    return (leftovers);: "I'm done assembling. Mr. Manager, here is the updated and ready notepad."

function#3 (The Cutting Worker): extract_line

His job is very precise: cut the final product.

    if ( !leftovers[len]) return (NULL);: A quick check: "Is the notepad the manager gave me empty? If so, there's nothing for me to cut."

    while (leftovers[len] && leftovers[len] != '\n'): "I will slide my pen across the notepad until I either find a newline marker (\n) or I reach the end of the text. I will remember how far I went (len)."

    if(leftovers[len] =='\n') len++;: "If the reason I stopped was a newline marker, then that marker is part of the product. I will increase my measurement by one to include it in the cut."

    return (ft_strdup(leftovers,len));: "I will call the Copy Machine function(ft_strdup) and tell him: 'Make me an exact copy of the first len characters from this notepad.' This copy is the final product that I will give to the manager."

function#4 (The Cleanup/Setup Worker): prepare_next_leftovers

His job is the hardest and most important for making sure the factory can continue to run: prepare for the future.

    while (leftovers[i] != '\n' && leftovers[i]): "Just like the Cutting worker, I'll find where the first line ends."

    if (!leftovers[i]): "If I searched the whole notepad and didn't find a newline (meaning this was the very last piece from the file), then there are no 'scraps' left. I will throw away the old notepad (free) and tell the manager there's nothing left (return (NULL))."

    i++;: "I found the newline. The real scraps start on the character after it, so I'll move my counter forward one step."

    nlo = malloc(...): "I will calculate exactly how many characters are left in the notepad, and I will request a new, empty page (malloc) that is the perfect size for these scraps."

    while (leftovers[i]) nlo[j++] = leftovers[i++];: "I will carefully copy every single character of the scraps from the old notepad to my new page."

    free(leftovers);: "Now that I have copied all the important information (the scraps) to the new page, I no longer need the big, old notepad. I will throw it away (free)."

    return (nlo);: "Mr. Manager, here is the new, clean notepad that contains only the leftover scraps. We are ready for the next shift."
